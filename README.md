This repository contains my daily practice solutions for Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA), mainly focused on problems from LeetCode.

I use this repo to:
* Improve problem-solving and code quality
* Track daily progress & consistency
* Explore multiple approaches when possible
* Revisit patterns and common DSA techniques

Topics:
Arrays & Strings
Linked Lists
Stacks & Queues
Trees & Graphs
Backtracking
Dynamic Programming
Sliding Window
Binary Search
Greedy Algorithms
Heaps & Priority Queues
Tries, Hashing and more...

Tech & Language:
All solutions are primarily written in:
Java

Repository Structure:
The structure may evolve, but generally follows:
dsa-practice/
 ├── topic/
 │    ├── ProblemName.java
 │    └── ...
 └── README.md

Problem Sources:
Most problems are taken from:
LeetCode

Why This Repository Exists:
This repo reflects my journey towards becoming stronger in:
* Algorithmic thinking
* Systematic problem solving
* Interview preparation
* It also acts as a revision base and reference point for myself and others.

Contributions:
This is a personal learning repository, so contributions aren’t expected.
